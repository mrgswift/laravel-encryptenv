    | Encryption Cipher
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This package uses Laravel's built-in Encryption API
    | Laravel Encrypter supports either AES-128-CBC or AES-256-CBC as a cipher.
    |
    | If you are concerned about the performance and scalability of your
    | application, AES-128-CBC should be more then sufficient to protect your
    | environment variables.  If you are more paranoid, you can use AES-256-CBC
    |
    | More on this here:
    | https://blog.1password.com/guess-why-were-moving-to-256-bit-aes-keys/
    |
    | Change 'cipher' below to AES-128-CBC OR AES-256-CBC to encrypt your environment
    | variables in your .env or custom config file (set custom config below)
    |
    */

    'cipher' => 'AES-128-CBC',

    /*

    | Encrypt Value Flag
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This will tell the EncryptEnv console command what flag to look for at the
    | beginning of each environment variable value, to trigger encrypting the value.
    |
    | For best results, use a string that has little probability of being inside of
    | an actual variable value. Though this package does only check the beginning of
    | each variable value, it is still possible to mistakenly choose an encrypt_flag
    | that is contained at the beginning of an actual variable value. If you make
    | this mistake, this package will partially encrypt the variable value causing
    | unexpected results and most likely making the variable unreadable
    |
    | The default included encrypt_flag should suffice for most setups
    |
    | NOTE:  This cannot be 'ENC:' but you can put anything else here
    |

    | Otherwise leave this blank.  Any custom config file must be located in
    | the laravel's default config path, which is docroot/config for most Laravel
    | environments. Laravel has the helper function config_path() to return this
    | path if you are unsure what this path is.

    | NOTE: If you set this, your .env file will be completely ignored by this
    | package
